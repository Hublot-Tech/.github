### What's a service
To define the basic properties of a service in an on-demand service application, we will use the following elements:
- **Service Name:** A name of fewer than 75 characters.
- **Service Description:** A clear and detailed description of the offered service, including its features, benefits, and terms of use.
- **Categorization:** Services should be categorized into specific categories or types to facilitate user search and navigation.
- **Pricing:** Service rates, including base costs, any additional fees (spare parts, required work materials, etc.), and accepted payment methods (full payment upfront or after completing a specific stage).
- **Availability:** Service hours and availability, as well as any geographical restrictions (to be specified during provider registration).
